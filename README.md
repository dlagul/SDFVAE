Two multivariate time series (structured CDN KPIs) datasets are used in our work (folders named dataset1 and dataset2) which span 78 days and 64 days respectively. <br> 
These two datasets are collected from two different provincial-level CDN edge sites of a top ISP-operated CDN. <br>
There are 7 abnormal sequences in dataset 1 and 5 abnormal sequences in dataset 2. <br>
These labelled abnormal sequences are confirmed by human operators. So they can be considered as the ground truth. <br>
The KPIs in the datasets include the out-bound traffic and in-bound traffic of CDN servers, cache hit ratio, average bitrate, and so on. <br>
For privacy reasons, these KPIs are anonymized and normalized. <br>
